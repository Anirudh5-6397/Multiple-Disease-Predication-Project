# Multiple-Disease-Predication-Project
This project is a Multiple Disease Prediction System implemented using Python and Machine Learning techniques. It aims to predict the likelihood of various diseases based on input symptoms provided by the user.
Symptom Input: Users can input their symptoms into the system.
Disease Prediction: The system predicts the likelihood of various diseases based on the input symptoms.
Machine Learning Models: The predictions are made using machine learning models trained on medical datasets.
User-Friendly Interface: Provides a user-friendly interface for inputting symptoms and viewing predictions.

Dataset and Models
Dataset: The machine learning models are trained on a dataset containing symptom-disease associations.
Models: Various machine learning algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Neural Networks may be used for disease prediction.
